Making a playable connect 4 with adverse AI

## Requirements

Thanks to pip, the list of requirements can be easily installed using:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the game

A Makefile is available to ease the launching of the game.

 - make: builds the necessary resources
 - make clean: deletes all build products
 - make run: runs the game in Single-Player mode

The most basic running sequence is therefore:
> make; make run
